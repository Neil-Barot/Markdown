# Chapter 1: Preliminaries

## 1.1: Reasons for Studying Concepts of Programming Languages

There are various reasons for students to study programming languages, some of which include:

### Increased Capacity to express ideas:
Learning different programming languages can expand a programmer's thinking by introducing new concepts and structures. Even if a language lacks certain features, programmers can simulate them using techniques from other languages they know. Overall, understanding various programming languages helps programmers think more creatively and solve problems more effectively.

### Improved Background for choosing appropriate languages
When starting new projects, many stick to familiar languages, even if they're not ideal. Expanding their language repertoire would help them choose better-suited tools. While some language features can be mimicked in others, it's better to use built-in features for smoother, safer, and more elegant solutions.

### Increased Ability to learn a new language
Computer programming is always evolving, requiring continuous learning. Understanding fundamental concepts makes learning new languages easier. Like with natural languages, knowing one well helps learn others. The TIOBE index tracks language popularity, showing the need for programmers to adapt. Understanding language basics is crucial for navigating language descriptions and choosing which ones to learn.

### Better use of languages that are already known
Most contemporary programming languages are large and complex. Accordingly, it is uncommon for a
programmer to be familiar with and use all of the features of a language he or she uses. By studying the concepts of programming languages, programmers can learn about previously unknown and unused parts of the languages they already use and begin to use those features.

### Overall advancement of computing
Understanding programming language concepts provides a global perspective on computing. Popular languages aren't always the best; sometimes, lesser-known ones are superior. Lack of familiarity with language concepts can lead to the adoption of less optimal languages. For instance, ALGOL 60 was considered more elegant than Fortran but wasn't widely adopted due to a lack of understanding among programmers and managers. Better-informed language choices could lead to superior languages prevailing over inferior ones in the long run.

### Criteria Definitions

1. **Simplicity**: This criterion evaluates how easy it is to understand and use the language. Languages that are simple tend to have clear and straightforward syntax, making them easier for programmers to learn and use effectively.

2. **Orthogonality**: Orthogonality refers to the degree to which language features can be combined and used independently of each other. A highly orthogonal language allows for a wide range of expressions and combinations without unnecessary restrictions or complications.

3. **Data types**: This criterion assesses the types of data structures and data types supported by the language. A language with robust data type support provides programmers with flexibility and control over how data is organized and manipulated within their programs.

4. **Syntax design**: Syntax design concerns the structure and rules governing the formation of statements and expressions in the language. Well-designed syntax enhances readability and writability by promoting clarity, consistency, and conciseness in code.

5. **Support for abstraction**: Abstraction allows programmers to hide implementation details and focus on higher-level concepts. Languages that support abstraction provide mechanisms such as classes, modules, and functions to encapsulate complex functionality and promote code reusability and maintainability.

6. **Expressivity**: Expressivity refers to the language's ability to concisely and effectively express computational ideas and concepts. A highly expressive language allows programmers to write concise and clear code that accurately represents their intentions.

7. **Type checking**: Type checking is the process of verifying the correctness of data types used in a program. Languages with strong type checking perform rigorous checks at compile time or runtime to ensure type safety, reducing the likelihood of errors related to data type mismatches.

8. **Exception handling**: Exception handling mechanisms enable programmers to gracefully handle runtime errors and exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution. Effective exception handling promotes robustness and reliability by allowing programs to recover gracefully from unexpected situations.

9. **Restricted aliasing**: Aliasing occurs when two or more references or pointers in a program refer to the same memory location. Restricted aliasing refers to language features or restrictions that limit the potential for aliasing, reducing the risk of unintended side effects and improving program reliability and maintainability.
