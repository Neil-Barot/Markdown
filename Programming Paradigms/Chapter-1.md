# Chapter 1: Preliminaries

## 1.1: Reasons for Studying Concepts of Programming Languages

There are various reasons for students to study programming languages, some of which include:

### Increased Capacity to express ideas:
Learning different programming languages can expand a programmer's thinking by introducing new concepts and structures. Even if a language lacks certain features, programmers can simulate them using techniques from other languages they know. Overall, understanding various programming languages helps programmers think more creatively and solve problems more effectively.

### Improved Background for choosing appropriate languages
When starting new projects, many stick to familiar languages, even if they're not ideal. Expanding their language repertoire would help them choose better-suited tools. While some language features can be mimicked in others, it's better to use built-in features for smoother, safer, and more elegant solutions.

### Increased Ability to learn a new language
Computer programming is always evolving, requiring continuous learning. Understanding fundamental concepts makes learning new languages easier. Like with natural languages, knowing one well helps learn others. The TIOBE index tracks language popularity, showing the need for programmers to adapt. Understanding language basics is crucial for navigating language descriptions and choosing which ones to learn.

### Better use of languages that are already known
Most contemporary programming languages are large and complex. Accordingly, it is uncommon for a
programmer to be familiar with and use all of the features of a language he or she uses. By studying the concepts of programming languages, programmers can learn about previously unknown and unused parts of the languages they already use and begin to use those features.

### Overall advancement of computing
Understanding programming language concepts provides a global perspective on computing. Popular languages aren't always the best; sometimes, lesser-known ones are superior. Lack of familiarity with language concepts can lead to the adoption of less optimal languages. For instance, ALGOL 60 was considered more elegant than Fortran but wasn't widely adopted due to a lack of understanding among programmers and managers. Better-informed language choices could lead to superior languages prevailing over inferior ones in the long run.
